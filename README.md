# Color-Detection

In my recent project, I developed a robust Color Detection application using a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques. Leveraging OpenCV, I created a user-friendly interface using Tkinter for seamless interaction. The application allows users to upload an image, and utilizing Pandas, it analyzes the colors present in the image.

To achieve accurate color recognition, I implemented a color detection algorithm by calculating the minimum distance from predefined color values in a CSV file. This approach involved elements of machine learning, as the algorithm iteratively identified the most matching color name based on RGB values.

I integrated image processing techniques, resizing images for optimal analysis and creating a real-time display of color information. The application employs Python's Pillow library for handling image formats. The project showcased my proficiency in computer vision, image processing, and data analysis.

Key technologies and skills demonstrated in this project include machine learning, computer vision, data analysis with Pandas, image processing with OpenCV, and GUI development using Tkinter. This project not only emphasized my technical abilities but also highlighted my understanding of diverse technologies in the fields of machine learning and computer vision.
